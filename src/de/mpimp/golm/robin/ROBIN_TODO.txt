ROBIN TODO LIST
===============

- 	Implement an open plug-in architecture for quality check functions
	and maybe also for the main analysis so that users and us can easily 
	extend the functionality. This could consist of an R template using 
	the placejolders __VALUE__ and a specification file that contains the
	title, info text and thumbnail path.

- 	Implementation of nice functions like probe ID blacklisting and a
	present call/absent call filter that can exclude probesets from the
	analysis and/or takes PC/AC info into account.

-	Implement quality check thresholds specific to chip type (for Affy
	chips only). Use the Affy lib to extract the chip type and then read 
	the set of sensible thresholds from a table (file) that can be easily
	extended/maintained. If chiptype unknown fall back to defaults.
	Personalized thresholds might be defined for the signal intensity
	distribution and RNA degradation behaviour (marek)

- 	Implement automatic warnings for more measures! NUSE can easily be
	incorporated maybe also RLE.

- 	Complete online help

-       properly implement annotation and pvalue correction for rankproduct-based analyses

-       finish the summary/report generator for all workflows and add some
        material and methods-style text generation that people can copy-paste
        into their manuscripts.

-       finish HTML output
