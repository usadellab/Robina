RobinMainGUI.plmInfoText=PLM\nUsing PLM a model is fitted to the probe levels (similar to RMA).Afterwards, the weights which had been used by robust regression to down-weigh potential outliers, can be visualized. This is done using the PLMfit option. Using this option, one is able to detect possible artifacts on the chips.
RobinMainGUI.rnaInfoText=RNA Degradation plots\nUsually reverse transcription is started at the 3' end whereas degradation often starts from the 5' end. Thus probes more 3' are usually higher in values than the 5' probes within each gene. Therefore, a plot of average intensities versus position usually gives an ascending line, with which degradation can be estimated. If used for an array batch potential differences in RNA quality can be estimated using this plot.
RobinMainGUI.histInfoText=Histograms\nUsing the histogram option of Robin, you get a smoothed histogram of probe intensities on the chip. Using this function you might be able to identify outlying arrays in your sample set.
RobinMainGUI.scatterInfoText=ScatterPlot\nIf you choose the scatter plot option, Robin calculates RMA expression values. These are then displayed in a scatterplot for each probe set. In an ideal situation you should get a 45\u00b0 line indicating no change of expression, outliers from this line represent candidates for differential expression. To aid in examining this plot helper lines indicating a two fold change (a threshold still used often when dealing with microarrays) are also drawn.
RobinMainGUI.normalizationInfoText=Normalizing microarrays:\n\nThroughout the process of a microarray experiment, several factors can influence the actual outcome of the measured intensities. For example it is quite unlikely that in a treatment and in a control sample the exact same amount of RNA was used and that the efficiency of the RTase was exactly the same. Moreover there might be differences in labeling efficiency etc pp.\n Therefore, techniques have to be employed that account for these differences, which convert the raw intensities of the individual probes into a corrected summary information for the probe set.\nGenerally Affymetrix microarray consist of probesets which contain on average 11 perfect match probes and 11 mismatch probes of 25 nt each.\n Here, the middle nucleotide of the mismatch probes is substituted for by a non matching one.\nCurrently, probably the most common normalization techniques are MAS5 as supplied by Affymetrix, the RMA (robust multichip average) and gc-rma.\nIn short, MAS5 uses both perfect match and mismatch probes on the chips. \nFirstly it determines if the perfect matches show more hybridization than the mismatches, in which case it will give the probe set a present call.\nThe signal fort he probe set is determined as the anti-log of the Tukey biweight of the value X=log(perfect match-mismatch adj) where mismatch adj is either equal to the mismatch value or smaller than that, so that the value perfect match/mismatch adjust is always a positive value.\nFinally the data is scaled.\nDue to the scaling and the fact that MAS5 only relies on single chip data, one can compare chips that were normalized in different runs.\nRMA, fits a model to the perfect match probes to correct efficiently for the background. RMA does not take mismatch probes into account at all.\nAfterwards, probe quantile normalization is performed and finally the data is summarized using a median polish procedure.\nRMA always works on a batch of microarrays. Thus, if you analyze chip A, B, C and in a different setup chips B,C,D it may well happen that the expression values of B and C are different in the two normalizations.\nGC-RMA takes the sequence of the pobes into account fore background correction. Otherwise it works very similar as RMA alone.\nA comparison of different methods to real-time RT-PCR was performed by Quinn et al. (2006).\n\nQin LX, Beyer RP, Hudson FN, Linford NJ, Morris DE, Kerr KF (2006) Evaluation of methods for oligonucleotide array data via quantitative real-time PCR.  BMC Bioinformatics. 17;7:23.
RobinMainGUI.pValCorrInfoText=-Bonferroni (simply multiplies the p-values by the number of comparisons)\n-Holm \nboth being applicable under any assumptions\n\n-Hochberg\n-Hommel\nboth are only valid when the tests are independent or non negatively associated or to adjust the false discovery rate at a given level (i.e. among the rejected null hypothesis %FDR are wrongly rejected) Benjamini Hochberg which makes strong assumptions Benjamin Yekutieli which is applicable under more relaxed assumptions.\n\nGenerally it is accepted to use Benjamini Hochberg FDR control when using microarray analyses on gene by gene basis. This FDR control type multiple testing correction is the most powerful, meaning that after correcting for multiple testing, in general it will reject most null hypotheses of all correction procedures. Therefore, you probably do not need to change it unless you assume that you might violate some of the assumptions of Benjamini Hochberg\n\nThe different corrections are discussed thoroughly in: Sandrine Dudoit, Juliet Popper Shaffer and Jennifer C. Boldrick (2003) Multiple Hypothesis Testing in Microarray Experiments Statistical Science 2003, Vol. 18, No. 1, 71;103\n\nBenjamini Y and Hochberg Y (1995).

RobinMainGUI.boxPlotInfoText=Boxplots and MA plots\nThe boxplots viualize the distribution of unprocessed log scale probe intensities. Generally in a perfect experiment all the plots should be in agreement with each other. Chips that show a strongly deviating probe intensity distribution might be problematic.\n\nIn the MA plots, the normalized log scale probe intensities are plotted against the log fold change in expression when compared to a synthetic chip that was created by taking probe-wise medians of all chips in the input set. A lowess curve is fitted to the scatter plot and the deviation of the data from the theoretically expected zero-line is estimated via the integral of the lowess curve over the zero-line. In addition to this the amount of probes that show a more than 2 fold change in expression are recorded and a warning is issued if the amount exceeds 5% of the genes. 
RobinMainGUI.NUSERLEInfoText=RLE - Relative logarithmic expression\nRLE plots are generated by subtracting the median log scale expression value for each gene across all chips in the input set from the individual (log scale) estimates for each gene. These relative expressions are displayed as boxplots. Based on the assumption that most genes will not be differentially expressed the boxes should be centered around M=0 and would ideally have a small spread. Strong deviations like larger spread or median values that are not close to 0 indicate problems.\n\nNUSE - Normalized unscaled standard error\nThe standard error estimates for each gene are normalized by dividing them by the median of all standard error estimates for each gene and then displayed as boxplots. Individual arrays that show a significantly more spread out or elevated NUSE might be of lower quality.
RobinMainGUI.PCAInfoText=PCA - Principal component analysis\nThe data generated in a microarray experiment can be understood as a matrix of p columns where p is the number of chips used with n rows where n ist the number of genes (probesets, probes) measured. Such a dataset can be visualized as a set of n points in an p-dimensional space. The principal component analysis reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by finding a small number of linear combinations of the data that explain most of the variance in the dataset. These are the principal components. The principal components are ordered by the amount of variance explained and subsequently the first two PCs are plotted against each other.\nHierarchical clustering.
