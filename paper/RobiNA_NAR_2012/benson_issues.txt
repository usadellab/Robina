MINOR THINGS:
-------------

The user guide shortcut is also broken (points to program instead).
----> SHOULD BE FIXED - TEST IT!

The start menu link to the help guide is broken and the
----> SHOULD BE FIXED - TEST IT!

Then I tried windows (it actually comes with R). It complains about R being too recent evn though it installed it.
----> FIXED 


MAJOR THINGS
------------

Everything worked fine in windows, except that it produces an error when I try to compare two single samples (no replicates), which I am sure some users will want to do.
----> FIXED - the error was caused by the plotMDS function and not by the general analysis


guide provided with the package is outdated; it only talks about microarray analysis. 
----> FIXED  -- STILL NEEDS A FAQ AND OUTPUT SECTION

Also, I could never reload my old projects (those that hit an error along the way).
----> IMPLEMENTED PLUS A POSSIBILITY TO BROWSE COMPLETED PROJECTS


I think its a considerable limitation that there is no option to report the expressions per sample or group. 
----> INCLUDED OPTIONAL RPKM OUTPUT TABLE


LINUX-ONLY ISSUES
-----------------

I made the mistake of trying to install it on linux first. They state that no external tool is required but it would also ask me where to find R every time.

I got the program working up to the point where it had to build the bowtie index. It would work on building the index forever.




THANKS
Overall, the program is user friendly and provides useful information. So I would accept submission of the manuscript if they fix the bugs.
