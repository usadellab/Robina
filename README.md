# Robina
This is Robina Arcas featuring Isoform and in the future single cell analysis. Uses Kallisto
The Arcas branch compiles in JAVA 8 again still lots of clean ups to do. 
Arcas drops in Kallisto for bowtie to allow isoform analysis important for polyploids and plants in general. 
In addition pseudpmapping is faster etc. Unlike our other workflows kallisto is chosen over salmon as kalisto is available for windows.
Simpler, easier done. At the moment single reads uses vague estimates of length as does salmon. 
But let's be open for SE data one needs insert size and some estimation of variation of the latter.
Genomic data will likely no longer be supported. (Thoughts?)
