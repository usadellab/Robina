_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     An internal function to be used by 'gcrma'

     bg.parameters.ns(x, affinities, affinities2 = NULL, affinities3 = NULL, span = 0.2)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: PM or MM intensities after optical background correction,
          before non-specific-binding correction.

affinities: Probe affinities for probes with known sequences. Used to
          estimate the function between non-specific binding and
          affinities.

affinities2: Probe affinities for the probes whose expected
          non-specific binding intensity is to be predicted. 

affinities3: Probe affinities for another extra group of probes whose
          expected non-specific binding intensity is to be predicted. 

    span: 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a vector of same length as x.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Rafeal Irizarry, Zhijin (Jean) Wu

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
