_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plot a graphical display of the estimated pfp vs  number of
     identified genes

          plotRP(x, cutoff=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: the value returned by function RP,  RPadvance or RSadvance 

  cutoff: threshold in pfp used to select genes

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A graphical display of the estimated pfp vs number of  identified
     genes, which is also the gene rank of its  original rank
     product/sum across all comparison. If cutoff  is sepcified, a
     horizontal line will be plotted on the  graphic to indicate the
     positon of the cutoff point, and  all genes identified will be
     marked red.

     Two plots will be displayed, one for the identification of 
     up-regulated genes in class 2, one for the identification of 
     down-regulated genes in class 2
