_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     8 cDNA chips from Alizadeh lymphoma paper

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(lymphoma)

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     'lymphoma' is an 'exprSet' containing the data from 8 chips from
     the lymphoma data set by Alizadeh et al. (see references). Each
     chip represents two samples: on color channel 1 (CH1, Cy3, green)
     the common reference sample, and on color channel 2 (CH2, Cy5,
     red) the various disease samples. See 'pData(lymphoma)'. The
     9216x16 matrix 'exprs(lymphoma)' contains the
     background-subtracted spot intensities (CH1I-CH1B and CH2I-CH2B,
     respectively).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The chip intensity files were downloaded from the Stanford
     microarray database. Starting from the link below, this was done
     by following the links _Published Data_ ->  _Alizadeh AA, et al.
     (2000) Nature 403(6769):503-11_ ->  _Data in SMD_ -> _Display
     Data_, and selecting the following  8 slides:

       lc7b019
       lc7b047
       lc7b048
       lc7b056
       lc7b057
       lc7b058
       lc7b069
       lc7b070

     Then, the script 'makedata.R' from the 'scripts' subdirectory of
     this package was run to generate the R data object.
