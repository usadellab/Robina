_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function background corrects PM probe data using LESN - Low
     End Signal is Noise concepts.

     bg.correct.LESN(object,method = 2,baseline = 0.25, theta=4)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: an 'AffyBatch'

  method: an integer code specifying which method to use

baseline: A baseline value to use

   theta: A parameter used in the background correction process

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This method will be more formally documented at a later date.

     The basic concept is to consider that the lowest end of intensites
     is most likely just noise (and should be heavily corrected) and
     the highest end signals are most likely signal and should have
     little adjustment. Low end signals are made much smaller while
     high end signals get less adjustment relative adjustment.
