18 November 2008: statmod 1.3.8

- qres.nbinom now works in more situations.  It now accepts
  a model fit from MASS::glm.nb or a model fit using
  MASS:negative.binomial() when the theta argument is unnamed.
  Previously the theta argument had to be named, as in
  negative.binomial(theta=2).

07 April 2008: statmod 1.3.6

- fixes to limdil() on estimate and upper bound of the confidence interval when all 
  cells respond to all tests.

  and lower bound of the confidence interval when there are more than one group and
  no cells responds or all cells respond to all tests in one of the groups.
