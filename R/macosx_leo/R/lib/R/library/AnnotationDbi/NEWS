		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.1.7


NEW FEATURES

    o	Annotation packages now have a function to display basic 
    	quality control information.

    o	5 Inparanoid packages have been added for use in studies 
    	involving homology.

    o	Ensembl gene ID maps have been added to all mammalian 
    	packages.

    o	MGI IDs maps have been added for all Mouse packages.

    o	Protein to gene mappings have been added to appropriate 
    	organism based packages so that it will be possible to get 
	from the IDs in the inparanoid packages to a gene based ID 
	for the 5 main organism types (ie. Human, Mouse, Rat, Fly, 
	Yeast).

    o	Support has been added for PFAM so that there can now be a 
    	PFAM.db package.

    o	AnnotationDbi is now compliant with the 1.0 schema definition.
